In this project I use the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitgaidhar/potato-disease-dataset for building a model and predictiong in which class the leaves of potato falls .

Data Preprocessing and EDA: 
1] In Data Preprocessing used various steps such as get data from directory, applying class_names function to divide data into classes , making batches of images and labels to predict easily.
2]Use EDA to get distributions of images by plotting a bar graph,calculated mean and standard deviation for each class and also plot them using histogram .

Building Model:
1]Use CNN model to predict the leves fall in which classes . 
2]Ploting accuraacy and loss for the same.

Predicting Images :
Write a functions to predict given actual images to predict images .
